#A Constitutional Roadmap

##Introduction
In light of ambiguities and misinterpretation of the United States Constitution
and Bill of Rights, I have drafted this constitution that solidifies my best
interpretation of the intentions of the founders of the country.  I am not
suggesting it be adopted as a replacement for the current document, but rather
that its core values be a guide to any nation constructing its own
constitution.  Elements from the US Declaration of Independence, Constitution,
and Bill of Rights have all been included.

##Rights
The rights of The People are the root principles of any society.  All just
rights derive from property.  One's rights are inalienable, and cannot be
restricted except in the case of criminal penalties set forth by a jury of 
one's peers.  Rights may be transferred to a custodian in the case of children
under 16 years of age.  All rights are returned to one on his/her 16th
birthday unless a jury of his/her peers decides otherwise.  

Infringement of the rights of another is the only incriminating act.

###1. The right of the individual to keep and bear property shall not be infringed.
One may own any item for any reason he/she wishes to own it, or without any 
reason.  Private property may not be taken for public use.

###2. One's body is his/her own property
A person may do anything he/she likes with his/her own body.  One may protect
his/her own body from harm using any means possible.  In the case that such
means violate another's rights, legal action may be taken by either party or
by the state to determine if the means of self-defense were justified in the
given situation.

###3. One has a right to speak and act freely
Any action may be taken on one's own property or on publicly owned property as
long as it does not infringe another's rights.

###4. One has a right to privacy and security in one's own property
No search or seizure of any individual's property may be conducted without a
warrant.  Such a warrant shall only be issued upon oath or affirmation, based
on probable cause, describing exactly the place to be searched and/or the
persons/things to be seized.

###5. One has an unlimited right to contract
One may form any agreement with any number of other people for any reason.
Agreements formed under coercion may be invalidated by a jury in a court of
law.  In the case that any party bound by the contract does not hold up the
agreed-upon terms, the contract may be challenged in a court of law, and
appropriate reparations may be decided by a jury.

#A Constitutional Roadmap

##Introduction
In light of ambiguities and misinterpretation of the United States Constitution
and Bill of Rights, I have drafted this constitution that solidifies my best
interpretation of the intentions of the founders of the country.  I am not
suggesting it be adopted as a replacement for the current document, but rather
that its core values be a guide to any nation composed of several states
constructing its own constitution.  Elements from the US Declaration of
Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights have all been included.

##Governmental Bodies

##Rights
The rights of The People are the root principles of any society.  All just
rights derive from property.  One's rights are inalienable, and cannot be
restricted except in the case of criminal penalties set forth by a jury of 
one's peers.  Rights may be transferred to a custodian in the case of children
under 16 years of age.  All rights are returned to one on his/her 16th
birthday unless a jury of his/her peers decides otherwise.  

Infringement of the rights of another is the only incriminating act.

###1. The right of the individual to keep and bear property shall not be infringed.
One may own any item for any reason he/she wishes to own it, or without any
reason.  Private property may not be taken for public use, only given.  The use
of owned property is at the sole discretion of the property owner or owners.
Any owned property may be moved from any place to any place at any time, or
carried on one's person at any time.  Property may be taken by the state only
with due process of law.

###2. One's body is his/her own property
A person may do anything he/she likes with his/her own body.  One may protect
his/her own body from harm using any means possible.  In the case that such
means violate another's rights, legal action may be taken by either party or
by the state to determine if the means of self-defense were justified in the
given situation.

###3. One has a right to speak and act freely
Any action may be taken on one's own property or on publicly owned property as
long as it does not infringe another's rights.

###4. One has a right to privacy and security in one's own property
No search or seizure of any individual's property may be conducted without a
warrant.  Such a warrant shall only be issued upon oath or affirmation, based
on probable cause, describing exactly the place to be searched and/or the
persons/things to be seized.

###5. One has an unlimited right to contract
One may form any agreement with any number of other people for any reason.  Any
rights used for bargaining in an agreement may be reclaimed at any time, and no
legal recourse may be taken to punish this act.  Agreements formed under
coercion may be invalidated by a jury in a court of law.  In the case that any
party bound by the contract does not hold up the agreed-upon terms, the
contract may be challenged in a court of law, and appropriate reparations may
be decided by a jury.

###6. Rights cannot consist of services or materials
Any proposed right that demands a service from anyone for any reason is invalid
because it would invalidate the right to free action of the proposed service 
provider.  Any proposed right that demands products from anyone for any reason
is invalid because it would invalidate the right to property of the proposed
caregiver.

###7. Common Law
  No person shall be held to answer for any capital, or otherwise infamous
crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by an impartial jury of his/her
peers; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself.  

  In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the
crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously
ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the
accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory
process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of
Counsel for his defense.

  Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 

###8. Power of the People
    The powers not delegated to the state by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to
the people.

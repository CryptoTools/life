# Simple Boost.Asio Client/Server
This is a neat little example of an extremely simple Boost.Asio client and server.  Perhaps someone will find it useful.  Threading would be nice if you want multiple simultaneous clients.  Boost.Thread would help with that.

## Building
make

## Running
Run the server: ./server
Then run the client: ./client

**Tada!**

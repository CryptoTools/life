This is a Camping application with some extra rv hotness.  rv is a little
Camping on Apache helper daemon, and can be found here:

Anyway, install that, and then put all this crap in /etc/rv.  Also, configure
Apache sort of like the following (which I have in
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/rv.conf):

<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName treehugger.who
  ServerAlias treehugger 
  ProxyRequests Off
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  ProxyPreserveHost On

  #Fix for Apache bug 39499
  SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1
  SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
</VirtualHost>

Then everything works.  There are dependencies required for rv to function,
and I'm using sqlite3 for my database.  If you're Ruby-savvy, you can figure
it out.

# Gigantic Lumber
Gigantic lumber is a reciprocal key exchange service, like the one offered
for a long time on biglumber.com.  Since as of November 2009 the key exchange
service there no longer works, and HTTPS has been disabled, a new service is
needed for this type of exchange.

## Dependencies
In Ubuntu, it's this:

  sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems libsqlite3-ruby libgpgme-ruby

In other OS's, you're on your own.

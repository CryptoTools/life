# Display Characters
## What?
So, there's a little 3x3 Font [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3x3) that's
pretty awesome, and I decided it would be nice if I could use it on my HD44780
LCD display using AVR.  I implemented it in LCDiesel, and this code requires
that.  The included code makes a little nametag with my name encoded in the
font.
## Why?
I wanted to make a little nametag for conferences.  I thought this would be a
cheap/cool/fun way to do it.

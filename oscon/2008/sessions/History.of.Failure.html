<h1>OSCON 2008, Session 5: A History of Failure</h1>
<h2>Ancient Greece</h2>
<ul>
<li>More than 2000 years ago

</li>
<li>Device - position of the stars, sun, planets, and moon

</li>
<li>First computer, but also first software collaboration

</li>
<li>Modification of device after created

<ul>
<li>Bugfixes

</li>
<li>Feature Creep

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plundered by Romans

</li>
<li>Sank, recovered in 1901.

</li>
<li>X-ray tomography, 2000 greek characters on the outside

</li>
<li>(Funny EULA)

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modern Times</h2>
<ul>
<li>First bug: 1947. A Real Insect

</li>
<li>1983: Therac-25 Radiation Treatment Machine

<ul>
<li>PDP-11

</li>
<li>Errors are caused by alpha particles and EM noise

</li>
<li>Picks the wrong mode 1 in 250M times, massive radiation overdose

</li>
<li>No hardware interlocks, software controlled

</li>
<li>Picked wrong mode 6 times in 3 years.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overcorrection killed a rocket because of absolute velocity vs. smoothed
velocity

</li>
<li>Self-destruct buttons

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>&quot;It&#8216;s possible to make mistakes so large they invalidate
your entire worth as a human being&quot;</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Australian = $40,000/year, over lifespan of 80 years, $3.17M

</li>
<li>Metric = lifetime effort lost

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug 1: AT&amp;T 1990</h2>
<ul>
<li>Switches fail, tell its neighbors, they remove it from the routing table,
bad switch spends 6 seconds trying to fix itself.

</li>
<li>Coming back up, it would 3way handshake with peers to add them back.

</li>
<li>Changed, still send fault, still self-fix, then just makes an outgoing call
to the other switches.

</li>
<li>Bug: 1st switch made the call, 2nd switch updating routing table, crashes
everyone!

</li>
<li>75M calls were lost

</li>
<li>Lost revenue = $60M, 2300 years of productivity lost.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1996: Tiwai Point</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aluminum smelter, computer controlled

</li>
<li>Comalco Australia programmed them

</li>
<li>2 hours behind AUS

</li>
<li>Leap year, computers couldn&#8216;t take day 366.

</li>
<li>All computers crash @ midnight.

</li>
<li>2 hours pass, same problem happens in AUS

</li>
<li>Cells melted, had to be replaced.

</li>
<li>Unknown cost.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Space vehicles</h2>
<h3>1996: Ariane 5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed bug 37 seconds after launch

</li>
<li>Veered off course dramatically

</li>
<li>64-bit FP to measure launch position

</li>
<li>Casting to 16-bit int

</li>
<li><b>No Exception Handling!</b>

</li>
<li>Overflow, negative! Rocket turned around!

</li>
<li>Reused code from Ariane 4, could only move 1/2 the horizontal speed

</li>
<li>Testing? The <b>bug showed up perfectly!!!</b>

</li>
<li>The bug showed up afterwards in simulation

</li>
<li>$370M lost!

</li>
<li>150 lifetimes, 12,000 years

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1998: Mars Climate Orbiter</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plummeted through the atmosphere

</li>
<li>Part of the code in imperial, some in metric

</li>
<li>Pound force, newtons :P

</li>
<li>Testing budget was cut before launch

</li>
<li>Mars Lander failed as well

<ul>
<li>Thrusters stopped working

</li>
<li>Landing gear started vibrating, thought it was on the ground

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>8300 years of time lost

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deeps Space 2: Hit Mars</h2>
<ul>
<li>644+ KM/h

</li>
<li>Sat in storage

</li>
<li>Launched it, and it hit mars

</li>
<li><b>Battery was dead!</b>

</li>
<li>$30M, 10 lifetimes

</li>
</ul>
<h2>2003: North American Blackouts</h2>
<ul>
<li>50M people

</li>
<li>2.38 x AUS, 1/6 of USA

</li>
<li>Who&#8216;s to blame?

<ul>
<li>El Nino

</li>
<li>Canada blames New York, but was a sunny day

</li>
<li>Canada blames a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania

</li>
<li>New York blames Canada

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Europe was saying USA had 3rd world electric grid

</li>
<li>6 weeks later, there was a big blackout

</li>
<li>First Energy in Ohio

<ul>
<li>14:14 Alarm system fails <b>SILENTLY</b>

</li>
<li>Display said everything was fine

</li>
<li>Remained in that state for 27 minutes, crashed

</li>
<li>Hot spare failed silent after 13 minutes

</li>
<li>345kV line goes down, alarm system isn&#8216;t working

</li>
<li>Automatic re-route, other lines pick up the load

</li>
<li>2 more lines went down, no one knows

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>11 more lines go down says MISO

</li>
<li>MISO calls First Energy to notify, then their own power went out

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Take away</h2>
<ul>
<li>Race conditions

</li>
<li>Test

</li>
<li>Deploy in New Zealand First

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1998: Auckland blackouts</h2>
<ul>
<li>LOTR: Where the orcs come from

</li>
<li>5 weeks without power

</li>
<li>150MWatts of load, 110MW of rated cable :P

</li>
<li>4 cables, 1 failed.

</li>
<li>Bad press recently, so no announcement

</li>
<li>150MW of power on 85MW of cable

</li>
<li>Cable 2 fails -&gt; 150MW of power on 50MW of cable

</li>
<li>Management willpower vs. physics. Classic.

</li>
<li>Blamed it on El Nino

</li>
<li>Actually a lack of sysadmins, engineers knew cables were overloaded

</li>
<li>1980: &quot;We should replace the cables, guys&quot;

</li>
<li>Cost: $150M to Mercury power, unknown to business

</li>
<li>Economic gain to Wellington: Priceless

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sysadmins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hard to get people to listen to you, doomsayers

</li>
<li>Disk failure, we need raid

</li>
<li>Power? UPS

</li>
<li>Listen to the sysadmins

</li>
</ul>

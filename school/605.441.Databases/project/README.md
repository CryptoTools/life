# 5Charts
This is a little project for my databases class.  Basically, it's an exercise
in how to use SQL to do basically everything.

The idea is simple - stock charts in HTML5 that are auto-updated and/or fetched
from Yahoo and Google, with user accounts that let you keep a chart list
and comments on the charts.

## Setup
1. Change the db name, host, and username at the top of **support.inc.php**.
1. Create a file called **credentials.txt** and put your sql password in there.
1. Create the database using the SQL in **sql/schema.sql**.
1. Load in the RSS feeds: **sql/load_feeds.sql**
1. Go to the site and play!
